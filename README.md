# FYP-Project
Objective: Apply evolutionary computation or swarm intelligence algorithms to perform scheduling of smart grid resources. The work will be conducted using Matlab or Python. Nature of Project: Programming, Computational Intelligence Project Deliverables: An optimization algorithm for maximizing the utilization of intermittent renewable generation, plug-in electric vehicles, and other storage options for economic and reliable operation of the smart grid. The design will also consider operational and probabilistic constraints on the availability and consumption of energy.
