# FYP-Project (Change the name to 'Optimization methods for ???')
Objective: Apply evolutionary computation or swarm intelligence algorithms to perform scheduling of smart grid resources (We do not concider resources). The work will be conducted using Matlab or Python. (Python only)

Nature of Project: Programming, Computational Intelligence 

Project Deliverables: An optimization algorithm for maximizing the utilization of intermittent renewable generation (do not concider generation), plug-in electric vehicles, and other storage options for economic and reliable operation of the smart grid. The design will also consider operational and probabilistic constraints on the availability and consumption of energy.
