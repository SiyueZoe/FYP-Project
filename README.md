# FYP-Project (Add name - Optimization method for ???)
Objective: Apply evolutionary computation or swarm intelligence algorithms to perform scheduling of smart grid resources (sources?). The work will be conducted using Matlab or Python (only Python as I understood). 
Nature of Project: Programming, Computational Intelligence Project 
Deliverables: An optimization algorithm for maximizing the utilization of intermittent renewable generation (we do not concider generation at all), plug-in electric vehicles, and other storage options for economic and reliable operation of the smart grid. The design will also consider operational and probabilistic constraints on the availability and consumption of energy.
