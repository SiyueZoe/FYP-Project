# Optimization methods for household load scheduling in smart grid
Synopsis: A typical smart grid integrates renewables and storage systems into the distribution system. Due to the uncertainties involved with the increasing penetration levels of intermittent generation such as solar and wind power, as well as the variation of loads in the system, it is necessary to optimally schedule, manage and control all of the elements in the smart grid to increase reliability and economic benefits. Further, the increasing number of plug-in electric vehicles on the road is huge asset as an energy buffer if optimally scheduled.
